Before you begin, please note that in the “Manage my services” interface, you can view all of your OVH solutions. You can also manage them all here, with the exception of the following services:

- telecom services (e.g. xDSL, VoIP, etc. - not available in CA)

- the MX plan email service

The page that appears will contain a table for managing your OVH solutions. In this table, you will see:

- the service’s name
- its name at OVH (may look like a reference ID)
- its renewal or expiry date
- its renewal frequency

Some services may be connected (e.g. a Web Hosting plan and a domain name). If this is the case, you can disconnect them from one another by clicking on the arrow button in the table.

If you have several solutions, the table may be more than one page long. You can use filters to:

- show a particular service by entering its name in the search field above the table, in the right-hand corner
- sort your services by several criteria, using the filters located at the top of the table 
- change the number of services displayed per page, by selecting a number from the drop-down menu below the table
